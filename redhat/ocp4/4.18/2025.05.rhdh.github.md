# integrate rhdh with github repo

We have a demo previous, following the doc [here](../4.15/2024.08.rhdh.book.md).

The old demo use the gitlab as source code repository, but this time we will switch to use github.

The upstream demo repository is here, it contains the newest code.
- https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/agnosticg.git
- https://github.com/redhat-gpe/rhdh-demo-entities.git
- https://github.com/redhat-gpe/janus-idp-gitops.git
- https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/backstage-workshop.git
- https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/software-templates.git

But We will still use old repo for this demo
- https://github.com/nepdemo/rhdh-book1-templates/tree/wzh

The forked repo will focus on:
- using github repo as source code repo for new projects instead of gitlab
- trigger pipeline by monitoring github repo new commits by using cronjob instead of github webhook
- modify the pipeline to compile new image with different tag, and update the deployment with the new tag.
