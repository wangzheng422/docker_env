# Monitoring github without webhook

This is an example YAML configuration using a Kubernetes `CronJob` combined with a script to poll a Git repository and trigger a Tekton `EventListener`.

This solution includes the following components:

1.  **A ConfigMap to store the polling script.**
2.  **A ConfigMap to store the latest commit SHA of the Git repository, serving as state storage.**
3.  **A ServiceAccount** for the CronJob's Pod to use.
4.  **A Role and RoleBinding** to grant the ServiceAccount permissions to read and update the state ConfigMap.
5.  **A CronJob** definition that periodically runs a Pod which executes the polling script.

Please note:

*   You need a container image that includes the `git`, `curl`, `kubectl` (or `oc` if on OpenShift), and `jq` commands. You can build a simple image based on `ubuntu` or `alpine`, or find an existing image that contains these tools. The example uses a placeholder image name `my-custom-git-poller-image:latest`.
*   You need to replace the placeholders in the YAML, such as the repository URL, branch name, Tekton EventListener Service name and namespace, etc.
*   The state storage uses a ConfigMap, and the script will read the `last-commit-sha` field within it and update it after successfully triggering the pipeline. This requires the CronJob's ServiceAccount to have permissions to modify this ConfigMap.
*   The polling frequency of this solution depends on the `CronJob`'s `schedule` setting.

```

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** In the YAML above, replace `YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL`, `your-branch-name`, `your-eventlistener-name`, and the namespace `tekton-pipelines` with your actual values. Also, ensure `my-custom-git-poller-image:latest` is a container image you own that includes `git`, `curl`, `kubectl`, `jq` and can run in your environment.
2.  **Create State ConfigMap:** Before deploying the CronJob, you need to create the ConfigMap used for storing state:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-state-configmap.yaml # Save the State ConfigMap section from the YAML above to a file
    ```
    Alternatively, apply only the State ConfigMap section directly from the YAML above.
3.  **Apply RBAC:** Apply the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-rbac.yaml # Save the ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding sections from the YAML above to a file
    ```
    Alternatively, apply only the RBAC sections directly from the YAML above.
4.  **Apply Script ConfigMap:** Apply the ConfigMap containing the script:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-script-configmap.yaml # Save the Script ConfigMap section from the YAML above to a file
    ```
    Alternatively, apply only the Script ConfigMap section directly from the YAML above.
5.  **Apply CronJob:** Finally, apply the CronJob definition:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-cronjob.yaml # Save the CronJob section from the YAML above to a file
    ```
    Alternatively, apply only the CronJob section directly from the YAML above.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Image Requirements:** Building or finding a suitable container image is crucial. Ensure the image contains all necessary tools (`git`, `curl`, `kubectl` or `oc`, `jq`) and can run in your environment.
*   **RBAC:** Ensure that the `git-poller-sa` ServiceAccount is correctly configured with permissions to `get` and `patch` the `git-polling-state` ConfigMap.
*   **EventListener URL:** `http://${EVENT_LISTENER_SERVICE}.${TEKTON_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local` is the internal service address format within a Kubernetes cluster. If your EventListener Service type is `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` and exposed externally, you might need to adjust the URL in the script or access it via Ingress/Route.
*   **State Persistence:** The state in this solution is stored in a ConfigMap. If the ConfigMap is accidentally deleted or modified, the state will be lost, potentially leading to duplicate triggers for old commits. More advanced solutions might use a database or dedicated state management service.
*   **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error checking (e.g., failing to get SHA, failing to trigger EventListener), but you can add more complex retry logic and error notifications as needed.
*   **Git Authentication:** If your Git repository is private, you need to configure the container to handle authentication (for example, by mounting a Secret containing Git credentials and configuring Git to use them). This will make the configuration more complex. `git ls-remote` can also embed credentials in the URL (not recommended) or use an SSH agent (more complex).
*   **API Rate Limits:** Polling too frequently might hit API rate limits imposed by Git hosting services (like GitHub). Set the `schedule` appropriately based on your Git service provider's documentation and your requirements.

This YAML provides a basic framework that you can adjust according to your specific environment and needs.
