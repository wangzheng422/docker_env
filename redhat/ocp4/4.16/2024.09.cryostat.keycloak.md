# using cryostat to monitoring keycloak

We have a low performance keycloak instance running on openshift, we do not know what is happening, we need to monitor it, to find out the root cause of the problem.

There are several ways to monitor keycloak, but the target keycloak instance is production system, we can not touch the system, we need to instruct the system administrator to do the monitoring.

So, as the first method, we can use cryostat to monitor the keycloak instance. Following this way, we can collect enough information using online-meeting with customer, and check several key metrics by screen sharing only.

# install cyrostat

To active cryostat on openshift, you can follow the steps here
- [cryostat on ocp 4.14](../4.14/4.14.cryostat.md#install-cryostat)

# active monitoring in keycloak

```yaml


```

# end
